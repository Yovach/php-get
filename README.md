A script that allows you to easily download PHP extensions under Windows with a command.

This project uses the [https://pecl.php.net/](pecl.php.net) website.

## Why develop php-get ?

For the installation of Windows, we suffer from the lack of "package-manager" which allows the installation of PHP extensions. Even if Microsoft develops a "package-manager" for software, I don't think we will be able to install PHP extensions thanks to their tool.

In my opinion, it is a very important point to be able to offer a tool that allows maintenance and installation of extensions.

## Note

Please take into account that this is not the final version of the project, there may be modifications on the commands or on the whole code.
